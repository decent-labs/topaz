Topaz is a self-hosted web service that secures data at scale on Ethereum.

- **Simplify Blockchain Software Development.** Integrate any existing
  application with Ethereum, enabling blockchain use cases without smart
  contract development or prior experience in blockchain development.

- **Bypass Transaction Constraints.** Topaz batches transactions into secure
  data structures, anchoring many transactions on chain at once avoiding the
  scaling constraints of transaction throughput.

- **Outscale Any Blockchain.** Our hybrid development pattern using data from
  centralized applications secured on decentralized networks enables the usage
  of blockchains for data integrity at the massive scale the web demands.

- **Trial with Ease.** Our SDKs enable Topaz integration with just three lines
  of code - now, anyone can experiment with using blockchains to create
  transparent, trustless applications with ease.

- **Go to Mainnet for Pennies.** Topaz enables applications that simply could
  not exist due to scaling constraints brought on by the cost of Ethereum
  transactions.

### Set up your `.env`

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Update appropriately.

### Spin up external services

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Start the API
